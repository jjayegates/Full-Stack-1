# Full-Stack-1

Architecture

In this full-stack project, multiple frontend development techniques were utilized. Express HTML provided a server-side templating mechanism, allowing dynamic content rendering. I also used JavaScript, which enabled interactivity and asynchronous operations on the client side. The single-page application (SPA) approach ensured a seamless user experience by dynamically updating content without full page reloads. This combination allowed for both server-side and client-side rendering, optimizing performance and user experience.

In regards to the backend choice, MongoDB offers flexibility in data modeling, scalability, and is particularly suited for projects expecting varied, evolving data structures. Its JSON-like BSON format ensures seamless integration with JavaScript-based frontend applications.

Functionality

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format, while JavaScript is a programming language. JSON is derived from JavaScript but is text-only and can be read by various programming languages. In the context of frontend and backend development, JSON serves as a bridge. Frontend applications send requests and receive data in JSON format, while the backend processes and responds similarly, ensuring a standardized communication protocol.

During the development of my project, I came accross a compatability issue regarding JWT.  To remedy this, I had to downgrade the JWT version.

Testing

In a full-stack application, understanding methods, endpoints, and security is crucial. Methods like GET and POST dictate how data is retrieved or sent. Endpoints are specific URLs where requests are directed. Security layers, like authentication and authorization, protect data integrity and user privacy. Testing these aspects involves ensuring endpoints respond correctly, methods function as intended, and security measures effectively protect against unauthorized access.

Reflection

Because of this course, I have now completed a Full Stack web application for the first time.  I have developed skills in using javascript, node, express, and so much more.  The addition of these skills on my resume will definitely make me more marketable and competitive in the work force.
